/*
 * Main Physics plugin
 * 
 * This will be the base of the physics engine.
 * 
 * General physics calculations will be in this plugin and
 * all specialized physics plugins (rigid bodies, cloth, etc.)
 * will inherit from this plugin.
 * 
 * This could contain an interface for objects that need physicking.
 * 
 * NOTE: this will probably stay empty until multiple physics
 * plugins are developed and common calculations can be extracted
 * and encapsulated here.
